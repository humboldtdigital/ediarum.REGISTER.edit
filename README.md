## What does it do?

ediarum.BASE.edit is an oXygen framework designed for the Author mode of the oXygen XML-Editor (http://www.oxygenxml.com). It is optimized for oXygen XML version 20.1. With the help of ediarum.BASE.edit, scholars can create and edit TEI-XML based transcriptions of historical documents. The transcriptions can be enriched in ediarum.BASE.edit with text critic, comments and links to an index. ediarum.BASE.edit is largely based on the TEI-XML subset "DTA Base format" of the German Text Archive.

ediarum.REGISTER.edit complements ediarum.BASE.edit and enables the editing of TEI-XML based indexes for people, places, organizations and terms in ediarum. The registers created with ediarum.REGISTER.edit can be stored in the XML database existdb and retrieved from there with the help of the existingdb app ediarum.DB and linked from the transcribed documents.
